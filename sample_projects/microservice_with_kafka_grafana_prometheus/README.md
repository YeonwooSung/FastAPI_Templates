# Demo project microservice in python with Kafka and Faust

### Description

This is a demo project to represent a way to implement Python microservices with Kafka and Faust library.

## Project structure

### 01_infrastructure

[01_infrastructure](./01_infrastructure) - contains basic infrastructure described in docker-compose.yml file. Contains all infrastructure services such as:
* Kafka
* Zookeeper
* Postgres
* PgAdmin
* Prometheus
* Grafana

In [.env](./01_infrastructure/.env) file described all versions and ports required for the docker-compose.yml
The [grafana](./01_infrastructure/grafana) folder contains preconfigured dashboards and datasources required for this docker-compose.yml
The [prometheus](./01_infrastructure/prometheus) folder contains preconfigured services to collect metrics by the prometheus service, required for this docker-compose.yml 

## 02_demo_server

[02_demo_server](./02_demo_server) - contains demo server [app](02_demo_server/app) and [Dockerfile](02_demo_server/Dockerfile) required to build it as docker image. The demo server produce random test data needed for demo.
 
## 03_data_requester

[03_data_requester](./03_data_requester) - contains data request microservice [app](03_data_requester/app) and [Dockerfile](03_data_requester/Dockerfile) required to build it as docker image. The data requester service request data from demo server and send it to a Kafka.

## 04_data_processor

[04_data_processor](./04_data_processor) - contains data processor microservice [app](04_data_processor/app) and [Dockerfile](04_data_processor/Dockerfile) required to build it as docker image. The data processor service read messages received from data requester via Kafka. Split data and upload to Kafka.

## 05_data_aggregator

[05_data_aggregator](./05_data_aggregator) - contains data aggregator microservice [app](05_data_aggregator/app) and [Dockerfile](05_data_aggregator/Dockerfile) required to build it as docker image. The data aggregator service read messages received from data processor via Kafka. And calculate average value for last 10 responses.

## 06_db_loader

[06_db_loader](./06_db_loader) - contains db loader microservice [app](06_db_loader/app) and [Dockerfile](06_db_loader/Dockerfile) required to build it as docker image. The db loader service read messages from data processor and data aggregator services and store this data to Postgres DB. 

## 07_api_gateway

[07_api_gateway](./07_api_gateway) - contains API gateway microservice [app](07_api_gateway/app) and [Dockerfile](07_api_gateway/Dockerfile) required to build it as docker image. The api gateway service provide HTTP endpoints to request data from Postgres DB.

## docker-compose.yml

[docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) - contains all services and infrastructure in one.
