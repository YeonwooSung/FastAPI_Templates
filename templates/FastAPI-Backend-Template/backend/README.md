<h1 align=center><strong>Backend Application üêç</strong></h1>

This backend application template consists of:

* Configure the [TOML](https://toml.io/en/) file for testing and linting.
* Create the backend server with FastAPI and Uvicorn,
* Connect the backend app with PostgreSQL server via the asynchronous SQLAlchemy with AsyncPG driver.
* Set up Alembic for the auto-generation of database migrations.
* Create `Account` (domain) class as our database entity `account`.
* Create data validation for our database entity with [Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/).
* Create formatters for `json` convention and `datetime`.
* Create authorization with JWT Token generator.
* Create hashing function generator and password generator.
* Create custom error/exception handlers for both source code and HTTP.
* Create dependency injections for utilizing our asynchronous session and C. R. U. D. repository class.
* Create account specific routes: `signup`, `signin`, `get all`, `get by id`, `update by id`, and `delete by id`.

**P. S. This README will walk you through the local development setup. If you prefer to run your backend app with docker, see the main README.**

## Python, VEnv, & Requirements Installation

**INFO**: All related to Python will be setup **IN** and **FROM** the `backend/` directory!

* Step 1 $\rightarrow$ Open your project root directory and set up your Python via `PyEnv`:

    ```shell
    pyenv install 3.11.0
    ```

* Step 2 $\rightarrow$ Create our virtual environment:

    ```shell
    pyenv virtualenv 3.11.0 YOUR_VENV_NAME
    ```

* Step 3 $\rightarrow$ Set the newly created virtual environment as your main Python interpreter in the root directory:

    ```shell
    pyenv local YOUR_VENV_NAME
    ```

* Step 4 $\rightarrow$ Install the initial project requirements with `pip3`:

    ```shell
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## SSHhhhttt ü§´ It's a Secret!

All secret variables are configured in the `.env`, but in this case since it is listed in our `.gitignore` you should create one and save it in the root directory.

The secret variables are accessed by 2 different files:

1. `backend7src/config/settings/base.py` $\rightarrow$ The `BackendBaseSettings` class contains all the secret variables. This allows us to set the values dynamically through out the backend application ("dynamic" because we only need to change the value in `.env` file without breaking any code).
2. `docker-compose.yaml` $\rightarrow$ When we initialize the `backend_app` container, we register all the secret variables as well for our containerized backend application.

## Database

**INFO**: No postgres server, no connection!

* Step 1 $\rightarrow$ Run your postgres server (if you use MacOS, I suggest the installation via [postgre14 homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/postgresql@14)):

    ```shell
    brew services start postgresql@14
    ```

* Step 2 $\rightarrow$ Go to your database editor choice and create a database for this application.

* Step 3 $\rightarrow$ Register your database credentials respectively in our `.env` file in the root directory.

* Step 4 (Optional) $\rightarrow$ To stop your postgres server, run:
    ```shell
    brew services stop postgres@14
    ```

### Alembic for Automigration

**INFO**: Files generated by `Alembic` can be found in `backend/src/repository/migrations/**` (if you don't see the `versions/` directory, make one!)

**INFO**: You need to import your domain classes in `backend/src/repository/base.py` for alembic's auto migration!

* Step 1 $\rightarrow$ Create the initialization of your database migration:
    ```shell
    alembic revision --autogenerate -m "YOUR NOTES ABOUT THE DATABASE MIGRATION HERE"
    ```

* Step 2 $\rightarrow$ Push the registered database objects to your database:
    ```shell
    alembic upgrade head
    ```

---

## Pre-Commit

**INFO**: Run **Step 1** every time you `git add` a file to identify any mistakes before `git commit`. Otherwise, you will re-write your perfect commit message again üëøü§¨ü§Æ

* Step 1 $\rightarrow$ Install the pre-commit hook:
    ```shell
    pre-commit
    ```

* Step 2 $\rightarrow$ For good practive, let#s update the hooks:
    ```shell
    pre-commit autoupgrade
    ```

---

## TOML Configuration

Check the `pyproject.toml` as the main configuration file for the following packages:

* Project documentation
* Black
* Isort
* MyPy
* PyTest
* Converage

---

## FastAPI Backend Server

**INFO**: Make sure that you are in the `backend/` directory!

* Stp 1 $\rightarrow$ Run the server:
    ```shell
    uvicorn src.main:backend_app --reload
    ```

* Step 2 (Optional) $\rightarrow$ To stop the server click simultaneously `control` and `C`

---

## Test with PyTest

**INFO**: For running the test, make sure you are in the root directory and NOT in the `backend/` directory!

**INFO**: The testing report is automatically generated and saved in `backend/coverage/**`

* Step 1: Run PyTest:

    ```shell
    pytest
    ```
